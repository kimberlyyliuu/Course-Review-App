As part of my software development class final project, my team and I developed a file-based SQLite database application, ensuring persistent storage for users, courses, and reviews. I led the team by orchestrating a clear project agenda as we applied agile methodologies throughout the development lifecycle. The final result was a clear and intuitive interface connecting various scenes within the application, prioritizing user experience with a strong emphasis on usability and aesthetics.
